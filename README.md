1. TrainPlatform.java - logic for following program - After running this file it will print input and output

Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
We are given two arrays which represent arrival and departure times of trains that stop.
Example Input & Output:
Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
Output: 3
Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40}
dep[] = {9:10, 12:00}
Output: 1

2. Numbers.java - logic for following program - After running this file it will print input and output

Given an array arr of size N and an integer K, the task is to find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.
Example Input & Output:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6}, K = 3
Output: 3 3 4 5 5 5 6
Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 10, 7, 9, 4, 15, 12, 90, 13}, K = 4
Output: 10 10 10 15 15 90 90
